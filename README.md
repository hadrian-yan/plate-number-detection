# plate-number-detection
focuses on developing a two-wheeled vehicle access control system using QR codes integrated with Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The system is designed to replace the manual parking card system, reduce card loss incidents, and improve security and operational efficiency within a campus environment.
# codeNew9.py
This Python program implements a license plate recognition and QR code–based access control system for vehicles using a Raspberry Pi. It uses a camera with YOLO object detection to detect license plates, EasyOCR to read and extract plate text, and generates a QR code for each recognized plate. The system stores data in Google Firebase Firestore, displays the QR code, and updates its status after use. A connected QR scanner verifies codes for vehicle exit, controlling red/green LEDs via Raspberry Pi GPIO to indicate access status. The program is designed to run in real time, supporting multi-threaded camera capture and QR scanning.
# qrcode.blade.php
This web interface displays real-time QR code detection results for a vehicle access control system. It periodically fetches the latest QR code data from the backend, showing the detected license plate, capture time, and generated QR code image. The interface automatically updates every second and switches between “waiting” and “vehicle detected” views, making it suitable for live monitoring at entry or exit gates. This website use framework laravel and integrated with firebase as database
